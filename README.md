# YNAB Balance Monitor

Projects the minimum balance of a checking account through the end of the current month based on scheduled transactions and credit card payment obligations from [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/). Sends an [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) alert if the balance is projected to drop below a threshold.

Useful for keeping most of your cash in a high-yield savings account while making sure your checking account stays funded.

## How it works

1. Fetches the current balance of your checking account
2. Fetches all scheduled transactions for that account within the monitoring window
3. Fetches credit card payment category balances (money earmarked to pay CC bills)
4. Deduplicates — scheduled transfers to CC accounts aren't double-counted
5. Walks day-by-day to find the **minimum projected balance**
6. If it drops below your threshold, sends an **alert** notification
7. On the update schedule (if configured), sends a routine **update** notification with the projected minimum regardless of threshold

## Setup

### 1. Get your YNAB credentials

- Go to [YNAB Account Settings → Developer Settings](https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer)
- Create a Personal Access Token
- Find your account ID:
  - Visit `https://api.ynab.com/v1/budgets/last-used/accounts?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN` and locate your checking account's `id` or
  - Choose the account in the sidebar and look at the URL: `https://app.ynab.com/(budget ID)/accounts/(account ID)`  

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### 3. Run

**With Docker (recommended):**
```bash
# Set SCHEDULE in .env (e.g. SCHEDULE=08:00), then:
docker compose up -d
```

The container runs as a long-lived service and checks on your configured schedule. Use `docker compose logs -f` to see output.

**Run once (no schedule):**
```bash
# Leave SCHEDULE empty or unset
docker compose run --rm monitor

# Or without Docker:
python monitor.py
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `YNAB_API_TOKEN` | Yes | — | YNAB Personal Access Token |
| `YNAB_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | — | ID of the checking account to monitor |
| `YNAB_BUDGET_ID` | No | `last-used` | Budget ID (or `last-used`) |

| `SCHEDULE` | No | — | `HH:MM` for daily at that time, or `Nh` for every N hours. Empty = run once and exit |
